# Todo list

This file contains all tasks that I need to accomplish for this project. I have
not determined a good method for organizing or prioritizing, so for now they're
in a haphazard, FIFO-ish order.

## Tasks

For now, tasks are broken down into:
  * **Documentation**: tasks related to repository documentation
  * **Analytics**: tasks related to site analytics
  * **Gameplay**: tasks focused on improving and expanding the game itself
  * **Design**: tasks dealing with UI/UX

### Documentation

- [x] Move TODO section from README.md to TODO.md
- [ ] Figure out prioritization system for TODO items
- [ ] Add appropriate credits for the works of others (cribbage board .svg,
      playing cards .svgs)

### Analytics
